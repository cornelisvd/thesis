Micro-sensor (iButton hygrochron) thesis work in Aquiares, Costa Rica - spatio-temporal interpolation. Several experiments have been conducted, as well as a larger project placing 100 sensors in a coffee-farm near Turrialba. Older data has been used from a project in Honduras covering the two main seasons (Bioversity International in 2013). Data will be re-structured once I will have a better understanding of GitHub in the coming weeks.
